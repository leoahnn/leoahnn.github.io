    <h1 class="title">(wip) parenting tips</h1>
    <p>
      - Have a contingency plan if baby doesn’t like a particular thing. You may
      have a baby who doesn’t mind what kind of wipes you use. Or you may have a
      baby who breaks out in a rash if you use a particular brand.
    </p>

      - Know where to get bottles/sterilizers/formula if breast feeding doesn’t
      work out. Feeding and sleeping habits turned out to be the most stressful
      aspects of early parenting life.

      - If you don’t have some form of childcare lined up (stay at home parent,
      other family, nanny, etc…), try to set up something before the delivery
      date. Child care in the U.S. is expensive and difficult to find.

      - If you need to apply for long term care through your state (some
      employers will require you to do so even if they also offer paid leave),
      bring the paperwork to the hospital so you can get signatures from the
      required people. A lot of this paperwork needs to be filled out and turned
      in by the mother in-person (or you will need to fill out a form giving
      someone else authority to do so). Finding the time with a newborn can be
      stressful.

      - Craigslist/FB market is a great place to find quality baby gear for
      relatively cheap. Identify the popular “top of market” brands (i.e.
      UppaBaby, HALO, etc…) and you can usually find them for less than
      half-price in good condition. D2C brands (think Warby Parker, but for
      strollers or baby food) also exist and provide a cheaper alternative to
      some of the more premium brands.
